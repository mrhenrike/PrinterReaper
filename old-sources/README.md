# PrinterReaper

> "Not all harvests come from death. Some come from the paper tray."

**PrinterReaper** is a modern fork of the PRET (Printer Exploitation Toolkit) project, reborn with a focus on modularity, automation, and offensive exploitation of printers in corporate environments.

### Planned Features:
- Modular support for PJL, PostScript, PCL, and IPP
- Automatic printer recognition and fingerprinting
- File enumeration and exfiltration
- Exploitation of unauthenticated administration commands
- DoS, spying, and spool control scripts

### Aesthetic & Philosophy
- Mystic, hacker, cyberpunk, and dark-styled
- For those who understand that the printer is a vector, not a peripheral

### In progress...
