## üéØ Usage Questions

### Q: How do I discover printers on my network?
**A:** Run PrinterReaper without arguments:
```bash
python3 printer-reaper.py
```
It will automatically scan your local network for printers using SNMP.

### Q: How do I connect to a specific printer?
**A:** Use the printer's IP address or hostname:
```bash
python3 printer-reaper.py 192.168.1.100 pjl
```

### Q: What does "pjl" mean in the command?
**A:** It specifies the printer language to use. PrinterReaper currently focuses on PJL (Printer Job Language). Use `auto` for automatic detection.

### Q: How do I get help on a specific command?
**A:** Use the `help` command:
```bash
# General help
> help

# Specific command
> help upload
> help lock
```

### Q: Can I automate testing?
**A:** Yes! Use the `-i` flag to load commands from a file:
```bash
python3 printer-reaper.py -i commands.txt <target> pjl
```

## üîí Security Questions

### Q: Is it safe to test on production printers?
**A:** **NO!** Always test on dedicated test devices first. Many PrinterReaper commands can:
- Disrupt service
- Modify configuration
- Delete files
- Cause physical damage

### Q: What commands are safe to use?
**A:** Read-only commands are generally safe:
- `id`, `ls`, `cat`, `download`
- `network`, `info`, `variables`
- `printenv`, `pagecount`

Avoid destructive commands without authorization:
- ‚ùå `destroy`, `format`, `reset`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `restart`, `lock`, `disable`

### Q: How do I avoid damaging the printer?
**A:** Follow these guidelines:
1. Always backup configuration first (`backup`)
2. Test on non-production devices
3. Read command help before using (`help <command>`)
4. Use `--safe` mode for verification
5. Avoid commands with ‚ö†Ô∏è warnings

### Q: Can PrinterReaper be detected?
**A:** Potentially yes. Printers may log:
- Network connections
- PJL commands received
- File operations
- Configuration changes

Use in controlled environments only.

## üíª Technical Questions

### Q: What port does PrinterReaper use?
**A:** By default, port 9100 (raw printing port). You can specify a custom port:
```bash
python3 printer-reaper.py 192.168.1.100:9101 pjl
```

### Q: Why is the connection timing out?
**A:** Try increasing the timeout:
```bash
# In shell
> timeout 60

# Or set longer default in code
```
See [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting) for more solutions.

### Q: Why do some commands not work?
**A:** Not all printers support all PJL commands. Support varies by:
- Printer manufacturer
- Firmware version
- PJL implementation
- Security settings

### Q: How do I capture PJL traffic?
**A:** Use debug mode or tcpdump:
```bash
# Debug mode (shows PJL commands)
python3 printer-reaper.py --debug <target> pjl

# Packet capture
tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap port 9100
```

### Q: Can I log all commands?
**A:** Yes, use the `-o` flag:
```bash
python3 printer-reaper.py -o session.log <target> pjl
```

---

## üêõ Error Messages

### Q: "Connection refused" error?
**A:** Possible causes:
- Printer is offline
- Port 9100 is closed
- Firewall is blocking
- Wrong IP address

Try:
```bash
# Test connection
ping <printer-ip>
telnet <printer-ip> 9100
nmap -p 9100 <printer-ip>
```

### Q: "No data received" error?
**A:** Possible causes:
- Printer doesn't support PJL
- Printer is busy
- Network latency high
- Timeout too short

Try:
```bash
# Increase timeout
> timeout 60

# Use safe mode to verify PJL support
python3 printer-reaper.py --safe <target> pjl
```

### Q: "Permission denied" error?
**A:** The printer may have:
- File system restrictions
- Authentication enabled
- Read-only volume
- Security lockdown

Try:
- Different paths
- Different volumes (0:, 1:, 2:)
- Unlock printer first
- Check security settings

```bash
> hold          # Enable retention
> capture       # Start capturing
```
**‚ö†Ô∏è Legal warning**: Only with authorization!

### Q: Can I backup printer configuration?

## üîç Advanced Questions

### Q: How does filesystem mirroring work?
**A:** The `mirror` command:
1. Recursively lists all files using `find`
2. Downloads each file using `download`
3. Recreates directory structure locally
4. Preserves file hierarchy

### Q: What is NVRAM and why is it important?
**A:** NVRAM (Non-Volatile RAM) stores:
- Printer settings
- Passwords
- Network configuration
- Print job history

Access it with: `nvram dump`

### Q: Can I test without connecting to a real printer?
**A:** Not currently. PrinterReaper requires a target device. For testing, consider:
- Using a dedicated test printer
- Setting up a printer emulator
- Using a virtual printer (limited functionality)

### Q: How do I contribute to PrinterReaper?
**A:** See [Contributing](Contributing) guide. We welcome:
- Bug reports
- New features
- Documentation improvements
- Security research

## üìä Performance Questions

### Q: How fast is network discovery?
**A:** Discovery speed depends on:
- Network size (number of hosts)
- Network latency
- SNMP timeout (default 1 second)
- Number of printers

Typical: ~2-5 minutes for /24 network

### Q: Can discovery be made faster?
**A:** Currently sequential. Parallel scanning planned for v2.3.5 which will be much faster.

### Q: Why is download slow?
**A:** Large files over network take time. Monitor progress:
```bash
> debug          # Enable to see progress
> download large_file.dat
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Questions

### Q: Can PrinterReaper damage printers?
**A:** Some commands can cause damage:
- `destroy` - ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Physical NVRAM damage
- `format` - ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Erases filesystem
- `reset` - ‚ö†Ô∏è Factory reset
- `flood` - ‚ö†Ô∏è May crash printer

Always read warnings and use only with permission!

### Q: How do I undo changes?
**A:** Best practices:
1. **Backup first**: `> backup before_changes.cfg`
2. **Document changes**: Keep notes
3. **Restore if needed**: `> restore before_changes.cfg`

Some operations cannot be undone:
- ‚ùå `destroy` - Permanent damage
- ‚ùå `format` - Data erased
